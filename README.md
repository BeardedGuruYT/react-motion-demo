# React-Motion with Create React App:

## What is React Motion?

React Motion makes animation easy using physics and allows you to animate the style prop of an element. 

It exports 3 main components, Motion, StaggeredMotion and TransitionMotion.


## Motion Component:
`<Motion />`

- Allows you to animate components within a page between style state.
- Children passed to this component should be a function that should render a component. That functionâ€™s argument is the style that should be used to render that component at that point in time.
- You can control the initial state with defaultStyle prop

```
  <Motion defaultStyle={{ opacity: 0 }} style={{ opacity: spring(1) }}>
    { (style) => <div style={style}>Can you see me?</div> }
 </Motion>
```

The motion component requires a styles attribute as well as a function inbetween the component tags which feeds into this.props.children. 

You have to pass in a number to the spring. React motion does some physics calculations or react motion magic.

**Required**
- style props
- Children passed to this component should be a function
- Must return one React element to render

**Optional**
- defaultStyle props


## Transition Motion Component:
`<TransitionMotion />`

- Helps you to do mounting and unmounting animation.

Takes willLeave, willEnter, and styles as the attributes as well as a function inbetween the component tags which feeds into this.props.children. 

**Required**
- style props which is an array
- Children passed to this component should be a function
- Must return one React element to render

**Optional**
- defaultStyle props
- willLeave props
- didLeave props
- willEnter props
- 



## Staggered Motion Component: 
`<StaggeredMotion />`

- Animates a collection of (fixed length) items whose values depend on each other, creating a natural, springy, "staggering" effect like so. This is preferred over hard-coding a delay for an array of Motions to achieve a similar (but less natural-looking) effect.

defaultStyles is a required attribute for the staggeredMotion component.





# Install: 

In your terminal run the following to create your react app and to install react-motion: 

`Create-react-app app` 

`npm install --save react-motion`

cd into your create-react-app folder and run `npm start`. Clean out the app.js file so there is only a single div in your return within your render.
